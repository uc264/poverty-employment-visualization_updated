Improved version of Project 1 with enhanced visualization features
# Project 1 - poverty-employment-visualization_updated (Version 2)

## Overview
This project presents an interactive web application that visualizes poverty rates, employment rates, and per capita income across U.S. counties.  
It features a choropleth map and a scatterplot for correlation analysis.

## Data Sources
- USDA Atlas of Rural and Small-Town America
- GeoJSON: US Counties shapefile

## Version 2 (Updated Submission)

### What I Learned
Through Project 2 and Project 3, I learned better design practices:
- Cleaner UI layouts
- Improving tooltip interaction with users
- Enhancing user experience with loading indicators, search functionality
- Correlation calculation and regression line in scatterplot

---

## Goals of Resubmission
- Improve tooltip interaction (follows cursor, formatted cleanly)
- Add search functionality for easy county lookup
- Smooth loading experience (spinners and progress bars)
- Implement better color gradients and legends
- Provide statistical information (correlation coefficients, deviations)
